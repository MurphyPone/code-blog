Getting those things right is core to having a successful event.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Domain.com:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Issue</strong>: The most common issue hackers encounter with the site is caused by higher-than-expected  frequency of domain purchases from a dense region/wifi Network.  Domain.com goes into lockdown as it looks like Credit Card fraud, and just prevents any new domain acquisitions until a ‘cooldown’ period has transpired.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Unfortunately, the only consistent fix (other than calling Domain.com support) is to wait a few hours then try again.  In order to prevent this measure, encourage hackers to register their domains earlier in the event (most still won’t).  Most teams register a domain after they’ve completed their main project to serve as a landing page, which usually happens in 3-5 hour window before project submission and creates a bottleneck.
