# General Tips
Be Proactive

Proactivity (the check to Murphy’s Law) - Anything that can be confirmed should be confirmed

Always be considering what could go wrong with the next big task of the day, whether that is a meal, a workshop, judging, etc. Have contingency plan for what you and your team can do if something goes wrong.  Try to have such a plan that when something does comes up, it’s not a crisis, it’s actually still part of the plan, just a sub-optimal plan B, C, …
Food: Call food caterers a day in advance, and then again 2+ hours before the intended delivery time to confirm that everything is still going to be on time and meet specified quantity
Volunteers:
Reserve one member of your organizer team to be the designated point of contact for volunteers: they should know (or have that information on hand at all times):
All the volunteers in the building at any given time, what their responsibilities are, etc.
Prepare physical packets (they can be generalized, don’t need to be volunteer-specific) for volunteers that contain:
The responsibilities,
The rules of the event,
Map of the venue,
Time table so they know when/where they’re supposed to be and who is going to replace them
Contact information for all relevant parties: Lead Organizer, Designated PoC for volunteer organizer,  Adult Moderator, custodian/venue staff (if there’s a chance that people get locked out of certain parts of the venue)
Etc. anything that would likely come up that they would otherwise have to find an organizer to figure out
Participants:
Have a concise and visually appealing FAQ/info packet (git repo, google doc, sub-page on website, make it as accessible as possible because hackers will not use it if it’s not insanely easy to get to and easy to navigate
Schedule,
Map with locations for Workshops, meals, mini-events, etc.
Important FAQ
Prize categories and details for eligibility
How to submit to Devpost
How demoing works/what judging is going to be like
Helpful resources for common APIs
This is like a super proactive thing - refer to my reference list!
A/V check: Day before and > 2 hours before
Volunteers/judges: one week and one day before hand
Caterers: (initial heads up about large order), One Day > 2 hours before
Scheduling: Give yourself at least an hour of margin-for-error before/after (as necessary) big tasks on the schedule.  I.e try to give yourself some padding between meals and workshop times, give yourself more time for judging than you think you need, and know that opening/closing/anytime-you-give-other-people-the-opportunity-to-speak will take longer than you think they will.  
Advice
Planning
Log everything: meeting times/durations, attendance, and most importantly a spreadsheet of all the hours contributed by each team member
This helps establish accountability within your team; a bloated team structure is hinders overall team effectiveness and culture
Promotes taking pride in your work
Quantifies your effort which is incredibly useful when soliciting school admin/superior powers that for support: “Last year, our team collectively volunteered x thousand hours towards the success of our event across A, B, C, D categories.”
“level-heads and were able to arrive at solutions quickly without breaking down which is a crucial characteristic in the hackathon environment where Murphy’s law dominates the playing field”
Opening/Closing Ceremony
Open with your mission/goals for the participants over the weekend, not logistics -- something to get the participants fired up
Close with logistics
Signage
Big, and easily identifiable
Event branding so they stand out from existing venue signage
Devpost
Post an example submission that serves as an example for what a final project should look like
Have participants submit a placeholder submission the evening before the projects are actually due so you can gauge how many teams you’ll be dealing with, and in what categories you need assign judges
Use the “assign table number” rather than your own system for increased compatibility
Expo - is a great tool that unofficially accompanies Devpost (e.g. search by prize category > print the resulting page that includes assigned table numbers > distribute to judges   
Utilize the devpost help resources, their dev team is super responsive on and helpful.
User Experience
Prepare as many secondary events/activities as you can manage based on personnel/$ resources
Don’t detract from the hacking purpose of the event
Workshops
Great things to do during regular meetings over the months between events
As hackers, you all know what you wish you knew when you first attended a hackathon
Put together digestible workshops that help new hackers hit the ground running with a foundation in a given programming language a well as resources they can leverage going forward
Sponsors are great for providing higher level workshops
MLH localhost!!
Smash/ping pong tournaments
Trivia
Bingo (sheets at every table based on hackathon achievables e.g. “submit to devpost”, “attend a workshop”,
Raffles (big (real prize) + small (hourly, custom raffle stickers?))
CTF puzzle hidden on website/accompanying resources/webpages
Communication
Slack/Discord - event staff are identified as such in their display name, including their main role so volunteers/sponsors/participants know who to message
Clear channel purposes, yet not too many otherwise people get overwhelmed and stop checking at all - (#Announcements (locked), #General (all), #Mentors (all), (all) Memes, #Event-staff)
Judging
Confirm with Judges one week and one day before they need to show up to confirm numbers
System: //TODO make pros/cons
Batches of top 3 + spreadsheet
Google Form
Paper Rubric
Example Demos
Snag winning projects off Devpost from other hackathons if you don’t have time to prepare projects yourself, just be sure not to misrepresent it as your own
One being as excellent as possible, the other being average
This gives your judges some baseline expectations for the quality of demos they should expect
Bonus: If using an automated scoring system (E.g. Google Forms), normalize the score distribution from all the judges based off the scores they give to these two example projects that way teams don’t get penalized for harsher judges, or disproportionately advantaged by easily-impressed judges
Keep your judging system/criteria simple: judges will only have 3-5 minutes to evaluate teams; you don’t bog them down with lots details to keep track of or a non-intuitive method of recording their scores   
Prize-categories
Make your demo-process as accessible as possible
Tradeoff between specific tracks and number of demos
Along with your event-specific demo categories, it’s a good idea to include catch-all categories like
Best First Hack		(Majority of team are first-time hackers),
People’s Choice	(Poll system or demo phase where people are allowed to go
view other people’s hacks)
Best ____ Hack //TODO I swear I had the adjective in my mind at 3:00 AM last night, but now I can’t remember what I was thinking of
Look at other events’ Devpost’s for ideas for categories.
Social Media
Ensure that hackers are ok with having their picture taken at the event via release form
Implement a system to distinguish people who would prefer not to be included in images (can be denoted by an alternate lanyard color, etc.)
Designate a team member to manage social media: Live Tweet the event!
Mini-events
Workshops
Demos
Award Ceremony
Maximize user interaction by including media in all posts - people are more likely to click on posts with gifs/pictures/videos than they are a bland, text-only Tweet/link to external site
Remain active year-round to retain followers
Crowdsource publicity by creating a Snapchat geofilter for the weekend

“Generally speaking, there are 5 things you need to organize a hackathon – a venue, food, power, wifi, and people. Getting those things right is core to having a successful event.”

API Quick Links/Troubleshooting
MLH Specific APIs
Domain.com:
Issue: The most common issue hackers encounter with the site is caused by higher-than-expected  frequency of domain purchases from a dense region/wifi Network.  Domain.com goes into lockdown as it looks like Credit Card fraud, and just prevents any new domain acquisitions until a ‘cooldown’ period has transpired.
Fix: Unfortunately, the only consistent fix (other than calling Domain.com support) is to wait a few hours then try again.  In order to prevent this measure, encourage hackers to register their domains earlier in the event (most still won’t).  Most teams register a domain after they’ve completed their main project to serve as a landing page, which usually happens in 3-5 hour window before project submission and creates a bottleneck.  Registering your domain first thing helps mitigate this issue.
Google Cloud Platform
SnapKit - documentation is high level, currently working on a more in–depth writeup
BlockStack
 Documentation page is very beginner friendly.  
User forum/Slack is super active and helpful as well
Amazon Web Services
GitHub
Register an account as a student and gain access to tons of educational resources and credit towards services including AWS, Heroku, etc.
