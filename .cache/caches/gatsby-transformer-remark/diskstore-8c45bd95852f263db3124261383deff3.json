Domain.com goes into lockdown as it looks like Credit Card fraud, and just prevents any new domain acquisitions until a ‘cooldown’ period has transpired.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Unfortunately, the only consistent fix (other than calling Domain.com support) is to wait a few hours then try again.  In order to prevent this measure, encourage hackers to register their domains earlier in the event (most still won’t).  Most teams register a domain after they’ve completed their main project to serve as a landing page, which usually happens in 3-5 hour window before project submission and creates a bottleneck.  Registering your domain first thing helps mitigate this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Platform</li>\n<li>SnapKit - documentation is high level, currently working on a more in–depth writeup</li>\n<li>\n<p>BlockStack</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/dapp_principles.html\">Documentation page</a></u> is very beginner friendly.  </li>\n<li>User forum/Slack is super active and helpful as well</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Amazon Web Services</li>\n<li>\n<p>GitHub</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Register an account as a student and gain access to tons of educational resources and credit towards services including AWS, Heroku, etc.</li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://education.github.com/\">education.github.com</a></u></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>General Resources for Popular Subjects</h1>\n<h3>JavaScript</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Daniel Shiffman / Coding Train - p5.js tutorials on hundreds of topics</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Machine Learning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sentdex - Extensive Python ML YouTube playlist with practical implementations of popular libraries as well as explanatory  from-scratch reproductions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/\">“Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Network”</a></li>\n</ul>"}
